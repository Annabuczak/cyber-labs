# Alert 006 - Admin Logons Outside PAW

## Summary

Multiple administrator logons detected from non-PAW systems.

## Observations

- Account: Administrator
- Source IPs:
    - 192.168.28.132 (51 logons)
    - 192.168.28.200 (8 logons)
    - fe80::da26:ad7f:80ca:8a7b (1 logon)
- Activity: Repeated logons outside PAW

## Analysis

Administrative activity is required to be performed exclusively from the PAW.

Observed behavior violates this policy. However:

- Activity is consistent and repetitive
- Limited number of source systems
- Matches known behavior of IT staff not following PAW guidelines

## Hypothesis

Most likely:

- IT administrators performing tasks from non-approved systems

## Action Taken

Consult with IT Operations to verify legitimacy of activity and reinforce PAW usage policy

## Verdict

❗ Policy violation – Requires validation
