# Alert 007 - Failed SSH Login Attempts (root)

## Summary

Multiple failed SSH login attempts detected for the root account.

## Observations

- User: root
- Protocol: SSH
- Authentication: Password
- Outcome: Failed
- Attempts: 6
- Source IP: 192.168.28.x

## Analysis

The root account is not used for remote access and is explicitly blocked from SSH login.

The observed activity indicates:

- Unauthorised attempts to access a privileged account
- Possible brute-force attack targeting root credentials

Additionally, the Linux environment has minimal activity, making such events highly anomalous.

## Hypothesis

Most likely:

- Brute-force or unauthorised access attempt targeting the root account

## Risk Level

High

## Action Taken

Escalated to Tier 2/3 for immediate investigation.

## Verdict

🚨 Malicious – Escalation required
